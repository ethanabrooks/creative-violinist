So much of education happens in classes where students are taught in a group.\u00a0Children can learn a great deal from others in a group, however, an art like playing the violin requires individual attention. Each child is unique.<\/p>\n<h2>Individual strengths and impediments<\/h2>\n<p>In a private violin lesson, the student\u2019s strengths can be built upon; impediments to progress can be addressed directly; inspiration can be encouraged. For example, I have one student who writes music. We start each lesson by playing what she has written. Another student has trouble with rhythm. We sing and clap rhythms from the Bartok Violin Duets before playing them. One student came in inspired by a friend playing Bach on the &#8216;cello. We are working on that piece. In a private violin lesson, unlike a class, we can jump on these opportunities and go.<\/p>\n<h2>Teacher student relationship<\/h2>\n<p>The constructive, mutually respectful, working, relationship with a non-parent adult in a private violin lesson is extraordinarily valuable for children. I have fond memories of my private violin teachers going back to my earliest studies. I have stayed in touch with some violin students for decades. I am currently in contact (thank you, Facebook) with two violin students whom I taught with as young teenagers in the Netherlands back in the early 1980\u2019s. They are both professional violinists.<\/p>\n<h2>Benefits of private lessons<\/h2>\n<p>Not that every violin student has to become a professional. The benefits of private violin lessons transcend merely learning to play the violin. They include:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Learning how to work independently, teaching oneself<\/li>\n<li>Develop problem solving skills<\/li>\n<li>Patience<\/li>\n<li>An appreciation of quality<\/li>\n<li>Immediate feedback<\/li>\n<li>Exercise memory<\/li>\n<li>The ability to take criticism, including self-criticism, and use it immediately<\/li>\n<li>Hands-on, creative, interaction with some of the greatest minds in human history: Bach, Mozart, Beethoven, Bartok, etc.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<div class=\"left-img\"><a href=\"#\"><img src=\"http:\/\/www.creativeviolinist.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/05\/me-and-Christopher-e1367866987260.jpg\" alt=\"student and teacher performing Bartok Violin Duos together\" height=\"290\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><\/div>\n<div class=\"left-section\">For more on my approach to teaching, practicing and performing the violin, click <a title=\"The violin: teaching, practicing, performing\" href=\"http:\/\/www.creativeviolinist.com\/?page_id=554\">here.<\/a><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Private Violin Lessons I offer private violin lessons in my home studio in Lancaster, Pennsylvania.
