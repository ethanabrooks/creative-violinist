We all play them.<\/li>\n<li>Create a group accompaniment on a D major chord, and encourage as many students as possible to take a shot at creating a solo (it could be just open strings).<\/li>\n<li>Repeat with a I IV progression in 4 bar phrases. The nice thing about this progression is that pretty much any note in the scale works.<\/li>\n<li>If there is still time, move on to I vi ii V (the fifties progression), introducing the dominant chord.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h2>More advanced material<\/h2>\n<p>More advanced groups may be able to cover more material, for example:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<ul>\n<li>More complex rhythms or meters<\/li>\n<li>Chord progressions from the literature, for example, from the Bach Solo Violin Sonatas.<\/li>\n<li>Blues progression<\/li>\n<li>Free improvisation. It&#8217;s nice to do this first in pairs, then as a whole group to avoid descending into aural chaos.<\/li>\n<li>Developing more layered and articulated accompaniments, exploring bass, rhythmic figures, arpeggiated inner voices, and counter-melodies.<\/li>\n<li>More refined work on developing improvised solos<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/ul>\n<p class=\"left-heading\">These are workshops in <i>improvisation<\/i>, so some adjustment to this outline is likely.<\/p>\n<p class=\"content-div1\">The sessions are recorded and posted in Dropbox so that students can enjoy the results.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"content-div1\">\n<div class=\"left-img\"><a href=\"#\"><img src=\"http:\/\/www.creativeviolinist.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/05\/LS-workshop.jpg\" alt=\"coaching orchestra class at Lampeter Strassburg HS\" width=\"700\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p><script type=\"text\/javascript\">\/\/ <![CDATA[ (function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i['GoogleAnalyticsObject']=r;i[r]=i[r]||function(){ (i[r].q=i[r].q||[]).push(arguments)},i[r].l=1*new Date();a=s.createElement(o), m=s.getElementsByTagName(o)[0];a.async=1;a.src=g;m.parentNode.insertBefore(a,m) })(window,document,'script','\/\/www.google-analytics.com\/analytics.js','ga'); ga('create', 'UA-59807837-1', 'auto'); ga('send', 'pageview'); \/\/ ]]><\/script><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Creative violinist workshops Improvisation for string players is on the cover of Strings Magazine, in the MENCE National Standards in Music&#8212;it is in the air.
